V200: A TI Voyage-200 emulator

To do and notice
================

1. Install [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/).

2. [Download the OS from TI's web site](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/voyage-200?category=resources). The current (and probably last ever) version is v3.10, with SHA256 sum:

        a819756f84bcb5c60729b9c2fe842473d3460ae5cd211aca1d8da4e09a04dcf3  os.v2u

3. `make -j1`

4. `./v200 os.v2u`


Why can't I type properly?
--------------------------

The Voyage-200 implements keyboard debouncing in software, so you'll have to
type very deliberately, as if you're using a little chiclet keyboard...

You will need an extended keyboard to hit some keys, and others aren't mapped
at all. This will probably be fixed eventually... maybe. In the meantime, read
the source for details.


Why doesn't the mouse work?
---------------------------

This isn't a touchscreen device.


How do I save state?
--------------------

You can't yet. Maybe later.


How do I upload/download files?
-------------------------------

You can't yet. Don't hold your breath.
